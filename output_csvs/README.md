This folder contains the output csv files that are generated by the main "taste_connectome_analysis" code. 
There are 3 csv files for each of the 4 taste modalities: one file with a list of all second-order neurons (2Ns), one file with a list of all third-order neurons (3Ns), and one file with a list of 3Ns classified by output location that excludes 3Ns without outputs in the brain.
